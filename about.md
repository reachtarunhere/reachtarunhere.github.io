<img style="float: left;margin: 10px;" src="{{ site.url }}/public/img/profile.jpg"> I am a pre-final year student at BITS Pilani double majoring in Biological Sciences & Electronics-Instrumentation. In the past I have been involved in Web Development (mainly back-end stuff). I also lead the technical team for [Oasis 2016](bits-oasis.org)  (Cultural Festival of BITS Pilani.)

I enjoy contributing to FOSS and have worked with Honeynet developing [Rumal](https://thugs-rumal.github.io/)  as part of Google Summer of Code 2015. Last summer (2016) I worked under the guidance of [Dr. Peter Norvig](norvig.com)  on Python implementations and visualizations for [Artifical Intelligence : A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/).

These days I spend most of my free time working through Deep learning MOOCs and Books.

## Blog

The blog is named Stanley as a tribute to [Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_%28vehicle%29)  the autonomus car which got me interested in CV and ML.
